# Navigating This Page 

This page was created to accompany the publication of **_Estimating the rate of plasmid transfer with an adapted Luria–Delbrück fluctuation analysis and a case study on the evolution of plasmid transfer rate_** by Kosterlitz et. al. We aim to provide a consolidated and accessible way of viewing the data, figures, and protocol steps as outlined in the methods of the paper. 
* **Data and Figures** are available in the links above. Refer to the figure number as mentioned in the paper to access the file with all data involved to create it. (I know this sounds awful, so fix it)
* **Protocol**  is available under the "Wiki" page (located as an open book icon at the top of this page)
* Example: [example CSV output]()
