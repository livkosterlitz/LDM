# Navigating This Page 

This page was created to accompany the publication of **_Estimating the rate of plasmid transfer with an adapted Luria–Delbrück fluctuation analysis_** by Kosterlitz et. al. We aim to provide a consolidated and accessible way of viewing the data, figures, and protocol steps as outlined in the paper. 
_________________________________________
## **LDM Protocol**  
Detailed steps are outlined and accompanied by visuals to outline the necessary phases of the protocol and their relevance in confirming results before proceeding with experiments. Video tutorial to proivde visual walkthrough of protocol steps can also be found here (coming soon).

## **Data and Figures** 
Repository for all raw data, calculations, codes, derivations, and final figures includued in the publication. Refer to figure number as ordered in the paper to access associated data and material. Link: [Figures](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Figures)
  > **NOTE:** Any additional raw data, codes or figures not included in the paper or supplement can be found under [Supporting Data](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Supporting_data).  

## **Simulations**
Digital experiments used to inspire feasible protocol designs and validate experimental data results. Instructions for how to designate parameters according to experimental setup using replication of strains tested in publication can also be found here. Instruction for how to customize for individual strains of interest also found included. Link: [Simulations](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations)

## **GitHub Appendix**
Liv is going to attach some very impressive and smart code-y things that will inspire awe and appreciation for the hours of work poured into this paper and website. I completely forgot what is going in the GitHub appendix or what its purpose is. But I can link it.  Link: [GitHub Appendix](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Github_Appendix)
