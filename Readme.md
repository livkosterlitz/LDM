# Navigating This Page 

This page was created to accompany the publication of **_Estimating the rate of plasmid transfer with an adapted Luria–Delbrück fluctuation analysis and a case study on the evolution of plasmid transfer rate_** by Kosterlitz et. al. We aim to provide a consolidated and accessible way of viewing the data, figures, and protocol steps as outlined in the paper. 
_________________________________________
- **Protocol**  - is available under < Protocol > or under the Wiki tab. Detailed steps are outlined and accompanied by visuals to outline the necessary phases of the protocol and their relevance in confirming results before proceeding with experiments. Video tutorial to proivde visual walkthrough of protocol steps can also be found here. 
* **Raw Data and Figures** - are available under < Main Data and Figures > folder. Refer to the figure number as mentioned in the paper to access all raw data, calculations and derivations, and final figures included in the paperthe file with all data involved to create it. Figures and not directly included in paper or supplement are litsed under the < Additional Data and Figures > folder. 
* **Data Analysis** - is available under < Data Analysis > folder. Refer to figure or data number as mentioned in the paper in order of appearence. Code packages used for computation of descriptive statistics and creation of individual figures found here.
