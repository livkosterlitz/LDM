## **Data and Figures** 
The [Figures folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Figures) contains all the raw data, calculations, codes, and final figures includued in the publication. Refer to the figure numbers as ordered in the paper to access associated data and material.

## **Simulations**
The [Simulations folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations) folder contains the code, workflow, and data generated from the Gillespie stochastic simulations.

## **GitHub Appendix**
The [GitHub appendix](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Github_Appendix) is available as a PDF file and contains the additional derivations mentioned in the supplemental materials. 

## **LDM Protocol**
