These programs create a stochastic simulation framework for modeling bacterial population dynamics to calculate conjugation rates. Given the amount of intermediate files generated, we did not deposit all of the files for each treatment used in the manuscript. However, we do include all of the files generated from [Step 3](#Step-3) for each treatment in the [Output_folder]() and a CSV file describing all of the various simulation parameters [Treatment_master.csv](). 

# The plasmid population model 

These programs implement a mathematical model describing the change in density of donors, recipients, transconjugants, and plasmid-free donors over time (given by dynamic variables *D<sub>t</sub>*, *R<sub>t</sub>*, *T<sub>t</sub>*, and *F<sub>t</sub>*, respectively). In the model, each population type grows exponentially at a population-specific growth rate (*&psi;<sub>D<sub>*, *&psi;<sub>R<sub>*, *&psi;<sub>T<sub>*, and *&psi;<sub>F<sub>*, respectively). In addition, each plasmid-containing population (donors and transconjugants) decreases as a result of plasmid loss due to segregation events. Transconjugants are transformed into plasmid-free recipients at the transconjugant segregation rate (*&tau;<sub>T<sub>*). Similarly, donors are transformed into plasmid-free donors at the donor segregation rate (*&tau;<sub>D<sub>*). Therefore, each plasmid-free population (plasmid-free donors and recipients) increases due to these segregation events at the population-specific segregation rates (*&tau;<sub>D<sub>*, *&tau;<sub>T<sub>*, respectively). Furthermore, the transconjugant density increases as a result of conjugation events from donors to recipients at the donor-to-recipient conjugation rate (*&gamma;<sub>DR<sub>*) and from existing transconjugants to recipients at the transconjugant-to-recipient conjugation rate (*&gamma;<sub>TR<sub>*). The recipient density decreases due to these conjugation events. Similarly, the donor density increases as a result of conjugation events at the transconjugant-to-plasmid-free-donor conjugation rate (*&gamma;<sub>TF<sub>*) and donors-to-plasmid-free-donor conjugation rate (*&gamma;<sub>DF<sub>*). The plasmid-free donor density decreases due to these conjugation events.

# Program Workflow

|Steps| Script |Step description| 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| [Step 1](#Step-1) | `SimSetup.py` | Pass simulation parameters to determine the necessary incubation time to run the stochastic simulation |
| [Step 2](#Step-2) | `SimRun.py` | Run the stochastic simulation with the calculated incubation time |
| [Step 3](#Step-3) | `SimAnalysis.py` | Combine the stochastic simulation results from many populations  |

A basic example is used to illustrate the workflow and provide details for all of the steps. 

# Program Requirements
The programs (`SimSetup.py`, `SimRun.py`, `SimAnalysis.py`) were written in [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and depend on several python packages:
  * [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
  * [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
  * [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
  * [Seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
  * [Gillespy2](https://pypi.org/project/gillespy2/)

## <a name="Step-1"></a> **Step 1** `SimSetup.py`

The user specifies the treatment(s) by providing modeling parameter values and initial density for each dynamic variable (*D<sub>t</sub>*, *R<sub>t</sub>*, *T<sub>t</sub>*, and *F<sub>t</sub>*). The `SimSetup.py` program runs a deterministic simulation on the treatment(s) using the plasmid population model. This is a quick computation capturing the average population dynamics of each treatment used to determine the proper incubation times for calculating the various metrics of interest (TDR, SIM, ASM, and LDM). The incubation time is a required input for running the stochastic simulation. Since each conjugation metric has different requirements, two different incubation options are created.
 
* I1: The total population density increases until a user-specified population density is reached. The incubation time needed to reach the specified density is calculated using a numerical simulation. 
* I2: The total population increases in density until a user-specified transconjugant density is reached. The incubation time needed to reach the specified transconjugant population density is calculated using a numerical simulation. This incubation time is typically shorter than I1 and therefore is used to run the additional populations that are necessary for calculating the LDM metric.

#### Inputs
The `SimSetup.py` program uses the custom functions provided by `SimFunction.py` to create shell scripts for running simulations based on the following custom inputs:
* -s/--SimRun_path: The **full** computer path to the SimRun.py program 
* -o/--output_folder: The folder for the output files
* -c/--csv_input: A user-created input CSV containing plasmid population model parameters and the cutoff criteria to determine the incubation time ([template input CSV](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Treatments/SimSetup_inputCSV_example.csv), more details in table below)

#### Terminal command
```bash
python Programs/SimSetup.py -s /Users/Fullpath/Programs/SimRun.py -c Treatments/SimSetup_inputCSV_example.csv -o Anyuserfolder/
```
#### Outputs
The program has the following outputs which are placed in separate folders:
1. Treatments: [example CSV output](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Treatments/SimSetup_inputCSV_example_with_incubation.csv)
> For each treatment (i.e., row in the input CSV), the program determines incubation times based on cutoff criteria provided by the user: (I1) maximum population size or (I2) maximum population size of transconjugants. The output CSV file is identical to the input CSV except for the two columns which return the incubation times (hours) that will be used for running stochastic simulations with the `SimRun.py` program. 
2. ODE_figures: [example ODE plot](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/ODE_figures/ODE_T1.pdf)
> For each treatment, a plot is generated for the deterministic simulation. 
3. ODE_data: [example ODE data](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/ODE_data/T1.csv)
> For each treatment, a csv file is generated alongside the ODE figure.  
4. SimData: [example Shell script](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/SimData/T1/T1.sh)
> For each treatment, one folder is generated containing one shell script (e.g., SimData/T1/T1.sh). Each row of the shell script is a stochastic simulation with the `SimRun.py` program. The number of rows will depend on the number of simulations requested by the user. 

## <a name="Step-2"></a> **Step 2**  Shell script for `SimRun.py`

Within each treatment's shell script, one row corresponds to one stochastic simulation with the `SimRun.py` program.

## <a name="Step-3"></a> **Step 3**  `SimAnalysis.py`

This program takes the stochastically simulated mating assays and calculates the various conjugation rate estimates at various incubation times. 

#### Inputs

The `SimAnalysis.py` program uses the simulated mating assays generated in [Step 2](#Step-2) from the `SimRun.py` program to estimate the conjugation rate using various metrics and provide various diagnostic plots describing the simulations based on the following custom inputs:
* -t/--treatment: The name of the treatment (e.g., T0)
* -c/--parameter_csv: The **full** computer path to the treatments CSV output generated in [Step 1](#Step-1) ([example CSV output](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Treatments/SimSetup_inputCSV_example_with_incubation.csv))
* -f/--csv_folder: The **full** computer path to the data folder containing the output files from [Step 2](#Step-2) (e.g., SimData/T1/)
* -o/--output_folder: The **full** computer path to deposit the output files

#### Terminal command
```bash
python /Users/Fullpath/Programs/SimAnalysis.py -t T1 -c Treatments/SimSetup_inputCSV_example_with_incubation.csv -f SimData/T1 -o Anyuserfolder/
```
#### Outputs
The program has two output folders with various files:
1. Analysis_estimates ([example output folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_estimates)): All of the files in this folder are in a standard CSV format where the rows correspond to one stochastic simulation from [Step 2](#Step-2) organized into various columns: 

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- | 
| Experiments| The output_filename used for `SimRun.py` (explanation of these filenames are in [Step 2](#Step-2)) | 
| LDM| LDM estimate. Note: LDM is only calculated for populations with I1 incubation times since populations with I2 incubation time are pooled to calculate p0. | 
| SIM| SIM estimate | 
| ASM| ASM estimate | 
| TDR| TDR estimate| 
| p0| The p0 value used to calculate the LDM. Note: Only the rows corresponding to populations with I1 incubation times will contain values given that 100 simulations with the I2 incubation time are pooled to calculate p0. | 
| Tt| The number of transconjugants at the incubation time used for SIM, ASM, and TDR | 

> For each treatment, there is a main CSV file (e.g., [T1_estimates.csv](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_estimates/T1_estimates.csv)) where all four conjugation estimates (LDM, SIM, ASM, TDR) were calculated at specific incubation times. The LDM incubation time is set to the average t*. For the other metrics, the incubation time is set is given by the time point for which an average of 50 transconjugants is reached. These incubation time are reported in the first row of the CSV file. 
  
> The ['Time_series' sub-folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_estimates/Time_series) contains files for various treatments and 15-minute time intervals. The files are named according to the treatment and the incubation time (e.g., [T1_1.0_estimates.csv](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_estimates/Time_series/T1_1.0_estimates.csv) corresponds to treatment #1 at a 1 hour incubation time.)
2. Analysis_figures: [example output folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_figures)
> For each treatment, there is main summary figure (e.g., [T1_I1_combined.pdf](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_figures/T1_I1_combined.pdf)) which shows the density of each population over time (top graph) and conjugation rate estimates over time (bottom graph). 
 
> The ['Densityonly' sub-folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_figures/Densityonly) contains population density over time plots for various treatments and incubation times. The files are named according to the treatment and the incubation time (e.g., [T1_I1_simulation_density.pdf](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_figures/Densityonly/T1_I1_simulation_density.pdf) corresponds to treatment #1 and populations ran with the I1 incubation time.)
  
> The ['Timeseriesonly' sub-folder](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/tree/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_figures/Timeseriesonly) contains time series plots for various treatments and conjugation metrics. The files are named according to the treatment and the conjugation metric (e.g., [T1_LDM_timeseries.pdf](https://github.com/livkosterlitz/LDM/blob/main/Simulations/BasicRun/Analysis_figures/Timeseriesonly/T1__LDM_timeseries.pdf) corresponds to treatment #1 and the LDM metric.)
